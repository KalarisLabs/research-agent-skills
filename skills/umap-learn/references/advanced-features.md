### Parametric UMAP

Parametric UMAP replaces direct embedding optimization with a learned neural network mapping function.

**Key differences from standard UMAP:**
- Uses TensorFlow/Keras to train encoder networks
- Enables efficient transformation of new data
- Supports reconstruction via decoder networks (inverse transform)
- Allows custom architectures (CNNs for images, RNNs for sequences)

**Installation:**
```bash
uv pip install "umap-learn[parametric-umap]==0.5.12"
# Installs the TensorFlow-backed Parametric UMAP extra.
```

**Basic usage:**
```python
from umap.parametric_umap import ParametricUMAP

# Default architecture (3-layer 100-neuron fully-connected network)
embedder = ParametricUMAP()
embedding = embedder.fit_transform(data)

# Transform new data efficiently
new_embedding = embedder.transform(new_data)
```

**Custom architecture:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define custom encoder
encoder = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(shape=(input_dim,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)  # Output dimension
])

embedder = ParametricUMAP(encoder=encoder, dims=(input_dim,))
embedding = embedder.fit_transform(data)
```

**Persistence:** Save Parametric UMAP with its built-in Keras-aware methods rather than plain pickle:

```python
embedder.save("parametric_umap_model", exclude_raw_data=True)

from umap.parametric_umap import load_ParametricUMAP
loaded = load_ParametricUMAP("parametric_umap_model")
new_embedding = loaded.transform(new_data)
```

Recent 0.5.12 fixes include Parametric UMAP retraining stability improvements and metric-gradient fixes, so prefer the pinned current release for neural-network workflows.

**When to use Parametric UMAP:**
- Need efficient transformation of new data after training
- Require reconstruction capabilities (inverse transforms)
- Want to combine UMAP with autoencoders
- Working with complex data types (images, sequences) benefiting from specialized architectures

### Inverse Transforms

Inverse transforms enable reconstruction of high-dimensional data from low-dimensional embeddings.

**Basic usage:**
```python
reducer = umap.UMAP()
embedding = reducer.fit_transform(data)

# Reconstruct high-dimensional data from embedding coordinates
reconstructed = reducer.inverse_transform(embedding)
```

**Important limitations:**
- Computationally expensive operation
- Works poorly outside the convex hull of the embedding
- Accuracy decreases in regions with gaps between clusters

**Example: Exploring embedding space:**
```python
import numpy as np

# Create grid of points in embedding space
x = np.linspace(embedding[:, 0].min(), embedding[:, 0].max(), 10)
y = np.linspace(embedding[:, 1].min(), embedding[:, 1].max(), 10)
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(x, y)
grid_points = np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()]

# Reconstruct samples from grid
reconstructed_samples = reducer.inverse_transform(grid_points)
```

### AlignedUMAP

For temporal or related datasets that need a shared coordinate system (time-series
experiments, batches), use `umap.AlignedUMAP().fit(datasets, relations=relations)`, where
`relations` maps sample indices between consecutive datasets and is required for meaningful
alignment. Parameters, methods, and a worked example are in `references/api_reference.md`
under "AlignedUMAP Class" and "Usage Examples".

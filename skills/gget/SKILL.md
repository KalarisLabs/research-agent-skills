# gget

## Overview

gget is a command-line bioinformatics tool and Python package providing unified access to 20+ genomic databases and analysis methods. Query gene information, sequence analysis, protein structures, viral sequences, expression data, disease associations, and mouse tissue/cell specificity metrics through a consistent interface. Most gget modules work both as command-line tools and as Python functions.

**Important**: The databases queried by gget are continuously updated, which sometimes changes their structure. Guidance here targets gget 0.30.5 (PyPI current as of 2026-06-07). For reproducible work, pin `gget==0.30.5`; for broken upstream database adapters, update gget after checking release notes.

## Installation

Install gget in a clean virtual environment to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# Reproducible install targeting this skill
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install "gget==0.30.5"

# In Python/Jupyter
import gget
```

## Quick Start

Basic usage pattern for all modules:

```bash
# Command-line
gget <module> [arguments] [options]

# Python
gget.module(arguments, options)
```

Most modules return:
- **Command-line**: JSON (default) or CSV with `-csv` flag
- **Python**: DataFrame or dictionary

Common flags across modules:
- `-o/--out`: Save results to file
- `-q/--quiet`: Suppress progress information
- `-csv`: Return CSV format (command-line only)

Python argument names generally match long CLI options without leading dashes. For example, `--census_version` becomes `census_version=...`. Use `gget <module> --help` for the exact current signature.

## Module Categories

gget exposes 23 modules in six categories. Parameters, CLI and Python examples, and
return shapes for every one are in
[references/module_catalog.md](references/module_catalog.md); fuller per-parameter
documentation is in [references/module_reference.md](references/module_reference.md).

| Category | Modules |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Reference & gene information | `ref` (Ensembl reference downloads), `search` (gene search), `info` (gene/transcript detail), `seq` (nucleotide and protein sequences) |
| 2. Sequence analysis & alignment | `blast`, `blat`, `muscle` (multiple alignment), `diamond` (local alignment) |
| 3. Structural & protein analysis | `pdb` (structures and metadata), `alphafold` (structure prediction), `elm` (linear motifs) |
| 4. Expression & disease data | `archs4` (correlation, tissue expression), `cellxgene` (single-cell), `enrichr` (enrichment), `bgee` (orthology and expression), `opentargets` (disease and drug), `cbio` (cancer genomics), `cosmic` (mutations) |
| 5. Viral & mouse specificity | `virus` (viral sequences), `8cube` (mouse specificity and expression) |
| 6. Additional tools | `mutate` (mutated sequences), `gpt` (text generation), `setup` (install module dependencies) |

Several modules need a one-time `gget setup` before first use (`alphafold`, `elm`,
`cellxgene`), and `cosmic` prompts for COSMIC credentials to download its database.

## Common Workflows

Worked multi-module pipelines — gene characterization, structural comparison, expression
and enrichment analysis, disease and drug association, orthology comparison, and
reference-file preparation for kallisto or alignment — are in
[references/common_workflows.md](references/common_workflows.md), with longer versions in
[references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md).

## Best Practices

### Data Retrieval
- Use `--limit` to control result sizes for large queries
- Save results with `-o/--out` for reproducibility
- Check database versions/releases for consistency across analyses
- Use `--quiet` in production scripts to reduce output

### Sequence Analysis
- For BLAST/BLAT, start with default parameters, then adjust sensitivity
- Use `gget diamond` with `--threads` for faster local alignment
- Save DIAMOND databases with `--diamond_db` for repeated queries
- For multiple sequence alignment, use `-s5/--super5` for large datasets

### Expression and Disease Data
- Gene symbols are case-sensitive in cellxgene (e.g., 'PAX7' vs 'Pax7')
- Run `gget setup` before first use of alphafold, cellxgene, elm, gpt
- For enrichment analysis, use database shortcuts for convenience
- Cache cBioPortal data with `-dd` to avoid repeated downloads
- For OpenTargets, inspect returned column names before writing filters; gget 0.30.5 follows the newer OpenTargets API schema

### Structure Prediction
- AlphaFold multimer predictions: use `-mr 20` for higher accuracy
- Use `-r` flag for AMBER relaxation of final structures
- Visualize results in Python with `plot=True`
- Check PDB database first before running AlphaFold predictions

### Viral Data
- Use restrictive filters with `gget virus` before requesting broad viral datasets
- Keep `command_summary.txt` with downstream results for reproducibility and recovery after partial downloads
- Use `--baseline` and `--merge-results` to resume interrupted viral metadata/sequence downloads

### Error Handling
- Database structures change; when an adapter breaks, check upstream release notes and pin the newer fixed version explicitly
- Pin the known-good version for reproducible environments: `uv pip install "gget==0.30.5"`
- Process max ~1000 Ensembl IDs at once with gget info
- For large-scale analyses, implement rate limiting for API queries
- Use virtual environments to avoid dependency conflicts
- Keep COSMIC and OpenAI credentials in named environment variables or interactive prompts; do not write real credentials into examples, notebooks, or logs

## Output Formats

### Command-line
- Default: JSON
- CSV: Add `-csv` flag
- FASTA: gget seq, gget mutate
- PDB: gget pdb, gget alphafold
- PNG: gget cbio plot
- FASTA/CSV/JSONL folder: gget virus

### Python
- Default: DataFrame or dictionary
- JSON: Add `json=True` parameter
- Save to file: Add `save=True` or specify `out="filename"`
- AnnData: gget cellxgene
- DataFrame/JSON: gget 8cube specificity, psi_block, expression

## Agent operating procedure

1. **Check the environment.** Confirm network access, API keys (if required) and the database's current API documentation and rate limits.
2. **Pin down the inputs.** Confirm formats, identifiers and parameters from the data or the user. Ask rather than guess any value that changes the result.
3. **Run a small version first.** Fetch a single known record and check the response format before bulk queries.
4. **Execute the full task** using the instructions and references above.
5. **Validate the result.** Identifiers resolve, record counts are reported, and the database version or access date is recorded.
6. **Report.** State what was run (versions, commands, parameters), what was checked, and what is still uncertain.

| If this happens | Do this |
|---|---|
| HTTP 429 or 5xx errors | Respect rate limits with backoff, batch requests, and report partial results honestly. |
| A function, flag or endpoint in these instructions is missing in the installed version | Check the installed version's own documentation (`help()`, `--help`, official docs), adapt, and tell the user. Never invent an API. |
| A required input, identifier or parameter is ambiguous | Ask the user, or state the assumption explicitly before running. |

**Integrity rules**

- Never fabricate results, parameters, identifiers, citations or statistics. If something cannot be run or verified, say so plainly.
- Never invent accession numbers, IDs or records; report 'not found' instead.
- Treat version-specific details here as possibly outdated: confirm them against the official documentation for the installed version.
- Ask before actions that cost money, consume shared GPUs or cloud quota, touch personal or patient data, or cannot be undone.

description: Install research agent skills for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot, OpenCode and Windsurf with one command, skills.sh, GitHub CLI, the Claude Code marketplace or a checksum-verified shell installer.
---

# Installation

## Install now with skills.sh

```bash
npx skills add KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills
npx skills add KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills --list
```

The first command lets you choose skills and agent harnesses; the second lists all available skills.
The skills.sh CLI installs into the current project by default. Add `--global` for your user account.
It supports Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, Windsurf and other
Agent Skills consumers. Tool permissions and advanced metadata can differ by harness.

## Curated research bundles

The Kalaris Labs npm installer provides field bundles after its first release. Until then, use
the skills.sh command above to select individual skills.

```bash
npx research-agent-skills list --categories
npx research-agent-skills search "systematic review"
npx research-agent-skills install citation-verification apa7
npx research-agent-skills install --bundle biology-research --project
npx research-agent-skills install --bundle ml-research --harness codex --project
npx research-agent-skills install --category life-sciences --harness claude-code,codex
npx research-agent-skills install --project          # into ./.claude/skills, ./.agents/skills, ...
npx research-agent-skills install --version 1.0.0    # pin a release
```

Manage installs with `installed`, `update`, `uninstall <skills|--all>` and `doctor`.
The CLI only ever removes skills it installed itself.

The curated `--bundle` choices are `research-essentials`, `ml-research`, `ai-research`,
`biology-research`, `chemistry-research`, `medicine-research` and `physics-research`.
Use individual skill names or `--category` when the bundle is too broad or too narrow.

## Alternatives

| Method | Command |
|---|---|
| skills.sh (Vercel) | `npx skills add KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills --list`, then `npx skills add KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills --skill citation-verification` |
| GitHub CLI | `gh skill install KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills [skill]` |
| Claude Code | `/plugin marketplace add KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills` → `/plugin install research-essentials@research-agent-skills` |
| No Node.js (macOS/Linux) | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills/main/install.sh \| sh` |
| No Node.js (Windows) | `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills/main/install.ps1 \| iex` |

Installer options via environment variables: `RAS_VERSION`, `RAS_BUNDLE` (bundle or category, or `all`), `RAS_HARNESS`.
The standalone installers also default to global user directories. Vercel's skills CLI has its own
scope prompts and flags; review its choice before installing.

## skills.sh discovery

The [collection skill](https://github.com/KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills/blob/main/skills/research-agent-skills/SKILL.md)
indexes all 280 specialist skills. Each specialist remains separately installable.
To install the entire collection into this project for Codex, run:

```sh
npx skills add KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills --skill '*' --agent codex --yes
```

Use another agent name if appropriate, or add `--global` for a user-wide install.

The public repository's `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` folders are discoverable by the Vercel skills CLI.
The directory page lists skills it has seen through CLI installs. The root `skills.sh.json` groups
those entries by audience; it does not submit unseen skills. Run
`npx skills add KalarisLabs/research-agent-skills --list` to verify repository discovery.
[Browse the directory listing](https://skills.sh/kalarislabs/research-agent-skills).
The directory's rankings use the CLI's anonymous install telemetry.

## Python for skill scripts

Skills with a `scripts/` folder run Python 3.9+ (many are standard-library only). For skills with
dependencies, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). `npx research-agent-skills doctor` checks your setup.

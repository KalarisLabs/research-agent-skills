# `scientific-schematics`

> Generates publication-style scientific diagrams as raster PNG images from a natural-language prompt, using Nano Banana 2 via OpenRouter, then scores each image with Gemini 3.6 Flash against a document-type threshold (journal, conference, thesis, grant, preprint, poster, etc.) and regenerates up to twice. Writes versioned PNGs and a review_log.json. Use when drawing neural network architectures, CONSORT or PRISMA flowcharts, biological signaling pathways, system or block diagrams, or circuit schematics. Use when a figure needs a quality score and critique recorded for a paper, poster, or grant. Not for vector, PDF, SVG, or EPS output, or for data plots; use a plotting skill for those. Prompts leave the machine, so avoid unpublished or patient data.

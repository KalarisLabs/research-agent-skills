**Research Agent Skills**, maintained by **[Kalaris Labs](https://github.com/KalarisLabs)**, is a free, open-source library of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for students, researchers and research teams.
Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` playbook, references and tested scripts. Your AI agent loads a skill
only when a task needs it: drafting a manuscript, formatting for *Nature* or IEEE, verifying references,
running a PRISMA systematic review, analyzing single-cell data, or answering reviewers.

It is built around the three ways AI research assistance goes wrong:

1. **AI slop.** `unslop-academic-writing` finds stock phrasing ("delves into", "pivotal role"), empty emphasis, stacked hedges and
   monotone rhythm, then rewrites toward specific, evidence-backed prose in the author's own voice.
2. **Hallucinated citations.** `citation-verification` checks every reference against Crossref, OpenAlex and arXiv. On our labeled
   benchmark it flagged every fabricated and corrupted reference and passed every correct one.
3. **Outdated venue rules.** Journal skills make the agent read the current author guidelines before formatting, instead of trusting memory.

## Install in 30 seconds

```bash
npx research-agent-skills
```

This interactive command lets you choose a bundle or category and the agent harnesses to install into.
The default choice is **research-essentials**: writing, journal formats, literature review, ideation and figures.
Installation defaults to your user account (global); add `--project` to install into the current project.
Then ask your agent, for example *"Verify every reference in refs.bib"* or
*"Unslop this introduction without changing any claims"*.

| Researcher | Curated bundle | Example command |
|---|---|---|
| Academia across disciplines | `research-essentials` | `npx research-agent-skills install --bundle research-essentials --project` |
| Machine learning | `ml-research` | `npx research-agent-skills install --bundle ml-research --project` |
| Artificial intelligence | `ai-research` | `npx research-agent-skills install --bundle ai-research --project` |
| Biology and bioinformatics | `biology-research` | `npx research-agent-skills install --bundle biology-research --project` |
| Chemistry and materials | `chemistry-research` | `npx research-agent-skills install --bundle chemistry-research --project` |
| Medicine and clinical research | `medicine-research` | `npx research-agent-skills install --bundle medicine-research --project` |
| Physics and astronomy | `physics-research` | `npx research-agent-skills install --bundle physics-research --project` |

Each field bundle is a focused starting set. [Browse all categories](catalog/skills.json) when you need a specialist skill.

**Installer targets:** Claude Code · OpenAI Codex · Cursor · Gemini CLI · GitHub Copilot · OpenCode · Windsurf · generic `.agents/skills` (including compatible Cline, Amp and Goose setups).
The skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification); other harnesses can use the folders if they support that specification. Tool permissions and advanced features may vary by harness. Every skill passes the specification's reference validator.

## What you can ask

```text
"Draft the Results section from results/ and the figures in figs/, then unslop it."
"Verify every reference in refs.bib and tell me which ones don't exist."
"Reformat this manuscript for Cell: Summary, Highlights, eTOC blurb and STAR Methods."
"Run a PRISMA 2020 systematic review on exercise and depression: search strings, dedup, flow diagram."
"Write a point-by-point response to these three reviewers within the rebuttal limit."
"Build a citation graph of my Zotero library and find the papers that bridge the two clusters."
"Check my LaTeX source before I upload it to arXiv."
"Analyze this scRNA-seq dataset with scanpy and write the methods section."
```

## Measured, not claimed

Every skill goes through a three-tier evaluation ([methodology and full results](benchmarks/README.md)):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Static quality rubric (structure, triggers, verification rules, tests) | Original skills: mean **95.5/100** · all skills: 95.3 |
| Trigger routing: 50 reviewed prompts, including near misses | hit@3 **1.00**, hit@1 1.00; false-trigger 0.12 |
| Citation verification on 18 labeled references (real, corrupted, fabricated) | precision **1.00**, recall **1.00** |
| No-slop writing: model abstracts with vs without `unslop-academic-writing` (pilot) | slop index **83% lower**, clean share 68% → 89% |
| Task outcomes with vs without skill, blind LLM judge (pilot, 23 tasks) | skill wins **21/23**, mean score 7.4 vs 4.3 |

Quality and routing gates run on every pull request, so a weak or overlapping skill can't be merged silently.

## Security

Skills are instructions and code that your agent runs with your permissions, so they are treated like software
dependencies. Every pull request runs spec validation, a prompt-injection and payload linter over all files, the Cisco
AI Defense skill-scanner, CodeQL, Semgrep, Bandit, secret scanning and dependency review. Scripts may only contact reviewed
domains. Releases are checksummed, signed and attested, and the installer detects tampered files. Details and
vulnerability reporting: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## FAQ

<details><summary><b>Can AI write my research paper?</b></summary>

It can make you much faster at outlining, drafting from your results, editing, formatting and reference checking.
You remain the author: every claim, number and citation must be yours and verified. Disclose AI assistance as your venue requires.
</details>

<details><summary><b>How do I stop AI from inventing citations?</b></summary>

Never accept references written from memory. Export them from publishers or Crossref, then run `citation-verification`.
</details>

<details><summary><b>How do I make AI-assisted writing not sound like AI?</b></summary>

Use `unslop-academic-writing`. It fixes vague content before word choice and calibrates to a sample of your own writing.
It improves clarity. It is not a way to hide AI use.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Is it free? Can I use it at my university or company?</b></summary>

Yes. MIT license. Some skills document third-party software or bundle publisher templates with their own licenses
(see [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)).
